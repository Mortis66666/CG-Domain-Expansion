        The game is played on a <const>7</const>x<const>7</const> board, where each cell is identified by coordinates ranging from (<const>0</const>, <const>0</const>) in the top-left corner to (<const>6</const>, <const>6</const>) in the bottom-right. Each player will control a token.
        <br><br>
        <h3> Movements </h3>
        During a player's turn, the player may either keep their token in its current location, or move it to another cell up to 3 steps away (measured in Manhattan distance). There must be an unobstructed path (not blocked by any wall or the other player's token) to be able to move to the new location. A token cannot be moved outside the board, or to a cell occupied by the other player's token.

        <br><br>

        <h3> Wall building </h3>
        After completing their move – or choosing not to move – the player must build a wall on any side of their token: <const>U</const>p, <const>D</const>own, <const>L</const>eft, or <const>R</const>ight. After a wall is built, neither player's token will be able to walk through it. A wall cannot be built on an existing wall.
        <br>
        At the start of the game, the border of the board is automatically a wall, hence you are also not allowed to build on it.

        <br><br>

        <h3> Game over condition </h3>
        A game is over if the walls on the board splits both players to two completely separated domains, meaning that neither player can reach the cell occupied by the other player.
